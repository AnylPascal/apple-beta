> It's easier if you install the file from your Apple TV instead. To do that, just go into the Settings app and choose **General > Privacy** and hover over **Send to Apple** without pressing it. Then press the Play/Pause button on your remote and click **Add Profile** on the hidden menu that appears. In the text field that pops up, type `https://tvos.urdailyspot.com` and press OK. When you are prompted to reboot do so. The software should then appear in **Settings > System > Software Update**. Additionally, you can still download the file to your computer for manual installation.
